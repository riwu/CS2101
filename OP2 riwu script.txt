Good afternoon everyone, i am Riwu. I'm here today, together with my colleagues, to introduce an amazing software product that will change your life.

Before i do that, i'd like to ask all of you a question: 
(click)

how many objects do you think your mind can hold in working memory?
(some high counts) sorry to disappoint you
(below 10) you are absolutely right!

According to a famous psychological research, 
(click)

commonly known as Miller's law, an average person can only hold about 7 objects in working memory!
(click)
Now, try to estimate the number of tasks you have to do every day. What about every week? every month?
(click)
Needless to say, it is humanly impossible to ensure that you remember all of them.
(click)

So, what i did was to the notepad app to record my tasks. 
(click)
However, it becomes disorganised and hard to read as my tasklist increases.

So i decided to search for a to-do list to manage my tasks instead.
(click)
To date, i have tried multitude of popular to-do lists in the market. Unfortunately, none of them meet my expectation.
Most of them are unstable, overly complex or so cumbersome to use that even the notepad app is far more superior.
Let me briefly show you one of the product, any.do
Let's say i want to add a task, workout every fri 3pm.
i will have to click on the add button, type in description, click on the date, select friday, adjust the time, click ok, add the task, locate this small button, select weekly, and finally press ok.

(sigh) How i wish i could do all of that in a single step!
Well, my wishes dont usually come true, but this time it did!

Let me now introduce our product: WURI.
(click)
WURI is a todo list app that allows you to perform a myriad of operations, just by typing commands through the input box here.

You easily add a task, with the option to specify the date or time. 
Tasks with no date specified will be displayed on a separate column here.

Your list will be conveniently sorted by date so that you know what tasks to focus on at one glance.

My team will elaborate on these functionalities and many more later.

Now, i would like to shift your attention to some core features that the existing products lack.
(click)

Firstly, our product is completely free and open source. Open source means that the source code, or in layman terms, the blueprint of the product is available to the public. 
(click)
This means that our product is absolutely safe and free of virus, as that would be easily detected from the source code. 
(click)
the product will also be continuously developed by anyone willing to contribute even if the original team abandon the product. 
(click)
The product will therefore never become obsolete and anyone can customise it to suit their needs.
(click)

Next, Our product can run on any machine with Java, which is a well-known application that can be easily downloaded at java.com, though chances are you already have it on your computer. 
(click)

This means it can run on almost any platform, including Windows, Linux and Mac.
(click)

Next, our product is highly reliable. The updated task list is saved to a file immediately after every operation you perform. 
(click)
Of course, our product is so stable that it will never crash, so why bother with saving it immediately? 
(click)

Do not panic, this is intentional. I'm sure all of you are familiar with the blue screen of death. While our product is guarenteed not to fail, i cant say the same for your computer or your home electricity.
By saving the tasklist to the file, you will not lose your data even in the event of a crash, unless your harddisk gets corrupted, which is very unlikely. But if u want to eliminate that risk as well, you could always set the storage path to your cloud storage folder, such as dropbox or google drive. Shaun will elaborate on that later.
(click)

Now, you may ask, if task list is saved to the file so frequently, will the app be slow? 
(click)
Not to worry, we have anticipated this problem and designed the product such that the updated task list and the feedback are displayed first before the saving is performed. 
(click)
Hence you will not notice any delay at all!

Moving on to the last core feature i want to highlight...
(click)
Ever find it frustrating that one of your hand has to constantly alternate between the mouse and the keyboard to use an app?
(click)
Our product is designed with it being completely mouse independent in mind. The keyboard is all you need to operate it.

Now you might be getting anxious: if all operation are performed using only the keyboard, will i have to type a lot of  keywords to perform an operation? 
(click)

Fret not, our product is designed such that you have to type a minimal of keywords.
Not only are our keywords single letter,  To add a task, you do not need to specify any keyword at all!
Dont believe me? i will pass on to Julian to demonstrate the product.
