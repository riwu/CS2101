Good afternoon everyone, i am Riwu, and these are the amazing teammates that i'm fortunate to work with for the past few months.
we here today to introduce an amazing software product that could revolutionise your life.

Before i do that, i'd like to ask all of you a question: 
(click)

how many things do you think your mind can hold in working memory?
(some high counts) sorry to disappoint you
(below 10) you are absolutely right!

According to a famous psychological research, 
(click)

commonly known as Miller's law, an average person can only hold about 7 objects in working memory!

Now, try to briefly estimate the number of tasks you have to do every day. What about every week? every month?
Needless to say, it is humanly impossible to ensure that you remember all of them.

So, what i personally did initially was to use the notepad application to record my tasks. However, it quickly becomes disorganised and hard to read as my list of tasks growed.

So i decided to search for a to-do list to manage my tasks instead. 
To date, i have tried multitude of popular to-do lists in the market. Unfortunately, none of them meets my expectation.
Most of them are unstable, overly complex or too cumbersome to use that i find even the notepad application far more superior.
Let me briefly show you one of the product, any.do
(demo a recur task)
 
I asked my colleagues for recommendation and apparently they share the same sentiments as me.

After the repeated failures and agony of finding a suitable to-do app, we had finally given up my search.

We decided to create a simple and reliable app ourself instead.

After months of tremendous effort, i am glad to say that we have develop a much more superior app that doesn't have any of the problems from the existing apps.

Let me now introduce our product: WURI.
(click)
WURI is a todo list application that allows you to perform a myriad of operations, just by typing commands through the input box here.

You easily add a task, with the option to specify the date or time. 

Your list will be conveniently sorted by date so that you know what tasks to focus on first at one glance.

Tasks with no date specified will be segregated to be displayed on a separate column here.

You can also set a task to recur at various intervals.

The application also allows you to modify and search tasks, undo and redo operations.

My team will elaborate on all these functionalities later.

Now, i would like to shift your attention to some core features that the existing products lack.

Firstly, our product is completely free and open source. Open source means that the source code, or in layman terms, the blueprint of the product is available to the public. 
(click)
This means that our product is absolutely safe and free of virus, as that would be easily detected with the source code. 
(click)
As an open source project hosted on Github, it also mean that the product will be continually developed by anyone willing to contribute even if the original developers abandon the product. 
(click)
The product will therefore never become obsolete and anyone can customise it to suit their needs.
(click)

Our product can run on any machine with Java, which is a well-known application that can be easily downloaded at java.com, though chances are you already have it on your computer. 
(click)

This means it can run on almost any platform, including Windows, Linux and Mac.
(click)

Next, our product is highly reliable. The updated task list is saved to a file immediately after every operation you perform. 
(click)
Of course, our product is so stable that it will never crash, so why bother with saving it immediately? 
(click)

Do not panic, this is intentional. I'm sure all of you are familiar with the blue screen of death. While our product is guarenteed not to fail, i cant say the same for your computer or your home electricity.
By saving the tasklist to the file, it will be safe even in the event of a crash, unless your harddisk gets corrupted, which is very unlikely. But if u want to eliminate that risk as well, you could always set the storage path to your cloud storage folder, such as dropbox or google drive. Shaun will elaborate on that later.
(click)

Now, you may ask, if task list is saved to the file so frequently, will the application be slow? 
(click)
Do not worry, we have anticipated this problem and designed the product such that the updated task list and the feedback is displayed first before the saving is performed. 
(click)
Hence you will not notice any delay at all!

Moving on to the last core feature i want to highlight...
(click)
Ever find it frustrating that one of your hand has to constantly alternate between the mouse and the keyboard to use an application?
(click)
Our product is designed with it being completely mouse independent in mind. The keyboard is all you need to operate it.

Now you might be getting anxious: if all actions are performed using only the keyboard, would i have to type a lot of additional keywords to perform an operation? 
(click)

Fret not, our product is designed such that you have to type a minimal of additional keywords.
Not only are our commands single letter,  To add a task, you do not need to specify any keyword at all!
Dont believe me? i will pass on to Julian to demonstrate the product.
